## Motivation

I created SimplyTrack out of a personal need to understand and improve my productivity. Like many developers and
professionals, I wanted to track my app and website usage to identify patterns, time-wasters, and productivity trends.

After trying several existing solutions, I found they were either:

- **Too complex** - Loaded with features I didn't need
- **Too limited** - Missing key functionality I required
- **Too expensive** - Overkill for simple usage tracking
- **Privacy concerns** - Sending data to external servers

So I decided to build exactly what I needed: a clean, privacy-focused, local-only productivity tracker that gives you
insights without the bloat.
